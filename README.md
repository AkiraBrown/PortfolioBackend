# Portfolio Site Backend

This is the backend for the my [portfolio site](https://github.com/AkiraBrown/PortfolioSite) that will serve as store for my blog posts and information regarding my other projects.

## Commands to get started!

- npm run test => starts jest test suite
- npm run build => creates a build variant of the backend
- npm run pg:init => initialises the postgres database
- npm run restart => re-initialises the postgres database and starts up the server (NOTE: Use with caution as it will get rid of any stored data on the database. I haven't implimented a backup command yet, so stay tuned)
